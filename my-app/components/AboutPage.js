                    Certify.doc enables individuals and organisations to vouch for the authenticity of offline documents.  
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The dapp provides a single utility: It issues a record on the ethereum blockchain that relates two addresses (an issuer and recipient) to an offline document. 
                    These records are immutable, non-tradable and revokable. They are similar to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) but have a a few important differences.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Certificates of authenticity
                    <li> cannot be traded or exchanged. They can only revoked.</li>
                    <li> are accessed by uploading the original document. They are readily accesible to those that are not familiar with blockchain technology.</li>
                    <br/>
                    {/* It means that */}
                    {/* <li> a person or organisation can issue a certificate to vouch for the authenticity of a document. </li>
                    <li> this document cannot be changed, only revoked. </li>
                    <li> certificates can also be used to give credibility of another person or organisation.</li>

                    {/* <br/> */}
                    Some possible use cases are
                    <li> Educators that certify the authenticity of their degrees.</li> 
                    <li> Employers that certify authenticy of employers statements.</li> 
                    <li> Individuals that authenticate their wills. </li> 
                    <br/>
                    In brief, certify.doc relates the social authority behind an ethereum address to an offline document, 
                    and expresses a relationship between two entities.
